# [ICIP-XLPSR Challenge Docker Submission Guide](https://xlim-perception.github.io/icip_xlpsr/)


This document explains how competitors should extend the provided **base Docker image** for the challenge and how the evaluation system will execute your submission.

> ⚠️ **Important**: The base system, CUDA version, OS, and core environment **must not be modified**. You are only allowed to install additional Python/system packages required for your method.

---

## 🐳 Base Image Policy

The provided base image already contains:
- Ubuntu 22.04
- CUDA 12.4.1 + cuDNN 9 (GPU support)
- Python 3.10
- Core ML & vision libraries (PyTorch 2.10, OpenCV, NumPy, etc.)
- Non-root execution user
- Predefined directories: `/input`, `/output`, `/workspace`

### ❌ You must NOT:
- Change the base image (`FROM ...` line)
- Change CUDA version
- Change OS version
- Switch to a different CUDA image
- Add system daemons (ssh, cron, services, etc.)
- Change user permissions or revert to root

Any submission violating this will be **disqualified**.

---

## ✅ How to  Install Additional Packages and   Incorporate Your Solution  

You may install **only the packages needed for your method** under te `INSTALL SPECIFIC PACKAGES` section of the Dockerfile. Make sure to indicate the version of the packages being installed.

### Python packages (recommended)
Use `pip`:

```dockerfile
# ---------- INSTALL SPECIFIC PACKAGES ----------
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir \
    timm \
    pytorch-lightning \
    segmentation-models-pytorch
```

Or via `requirements.txt`:

```dockerfile
COPY requirements.txt /workspace/requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /workspace/requirements.txt
```

---

### System packages (only if strictly necessary)

```dockerfile
# ---------- INSTALL SPECIFIC PACKAGES ----------
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    libgeos-dev \
    libgdal-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

⚠️ Avoid unnecessary system packages

---

### Incorporate Your Solution

Instructions to copy your solution **must be under te `COPY YOUR SOLUTION`** section of the Dockerfile. 
Copy your source and weights into `/workspace/`  and the  `run.sh` entrypoint

```dockerfile

# ---------- COPY YOUR SOLUTION ----------
COPY  src/    /workspace/
COPY  src/run.sh  /workspace/
```


---

## Directory Structure and Entry Point (MANDATORY)

Your container will have the following structure:

```
/input      # Read-only input data
/output     # Write-only output predictions
/workspace  # Your code
```

You **must not** write outside `/output`.

---

### Entry Point

Your container must provide a script that runs the full pipeline automatically and process all the inputs in /input

```
/workspace/run.sh
```

This script should:
1. Load input data from `/input`
2. Run inference
3. Write outputs to `/output`

---

### Input Interface

During evaluation, the system will mount the `/input` directory. It will contain a `csv` file listing all the available sequences, and the sequences in separate folders. Each folder will contain the frames of each video (in `png` format) and a `meta.json` file, indicating the bounding box of the license plate, and for the test set the ground truth text. 

```
/input
```

Example structure:
```
/input
  ├── all_samples.csv
  │
  ├── sample_0001/
  │     ├── img_01.png
  │     ├── img_02.png
  │     ├── img_03.png
  │     ├── meta.json (bbox, optionally ground-truth text)
  │     └── ...
  │
  ├── sample_0002/
  │     ├── img_01.png
  │     ├── img_02.png
  │     ├── img_03.png
  │     ├── data.json
  │     └── ...
  │
  └── sample_0003/
        ├── img_01.png
        ├── img_02.png
        ├── img_03.png
  │     ├── data.json
        └── ...

```

Your code must **only read** from this directory.

---

### Output Interface

Your container must write all results to the `/output` directory. One folder (with the same name as the input) per result. Each output folder must contain a super-resolved image `sr.png` and the recognized `text.txt`.

```
/output
```

Example:
```
/output
  ├── sample_0001/
  │     ├── sr.png
  │     └── text.txt
  │
  ├── sample_0002/
  │     ├── sr.png
  │     └── text.txt
  │
  └── sample_0003/
        ├── sr.png
        └── text.txt
```

Only files written in `/output` will be collected and scored.

---

## 🚀 Evaluation Execution Model

Your container will be executed as follows (conceptually):

```bash
docker run \
  --rm \
  --gpus '"device=0"' \
  --network=none \
  --read-only \
  --cap-drop=ALL \
  --security-opt=no-new-privileges \
  --pids-limit=256 \
  --cpus=4 \
  --memory=30g \
  -v input:/input:ro \
  -v output:/output:rw \
  your_image:tag \
  bash /workspace/run.sh
```

### Security
- No internet access
- No root privileges
- No access to host system
- No persistent storage
- No inter-container communication

---

### Resource Limits

Each submission will be executed with strict limits:
- CPU: **8 cores**
- RAM: **30GB**
- GPU: **RTX 3090 - 24GB**
- Time: max runtime per submission: **1 minute per image**

Submissions exceeding limits will be **terminated and scored as failed**.

---

## ❗ Rules Summary

✔ Install extra Python/system packages if needed  
✔ Use `/input` for reading data  
✔ Use `/output` for writing results  
✔ Provide a single executable pipeline in `/workspace/run.sh`

❌ Do not modify base image  
❌ Do not change CUDA or OS  
❌ Do not use network  
❌ Do not run background services  
❌ Do not write outside `/output`  

---



## 📦 Submission Packaging & Delivery


Participants must provide a **reproducible container submission**.


### Mandatory delivery contents
Each submission must include:

1. **Docker image** (exported archive)
2. **Dockerfile** used to build the image
3. **All files required to rebuild the image**, including:
- `requirements.txt`
- source code (`src`)
- scripts (`run.sh`, etc.)
- model weights **(they will not be downloaded)**


---


### 💾 How to Save Your Docker Image


After building your image locally:


```bash
docker build -t my_submission:latest .
```


Save the image to a file:


```bash
docker save my_submission:latest -o my_submission_image.tar
```


This file (`my_submission_image.tar`) is the **official image artifact**.


---


### Submission Format


Your final submission package must contain the following files, the **submission should be uploaded using the personalized invitation link provided by the organizers** 


```
submission/
├── my_submission_image.tar # Docker image archive
├── Dockerfile # Build recipe
├── run.sh # Entry point
├── requirements.txt # (if used)
├── src/ # Your code
└── README.md # (optional description)
```


---


### Reproducibility Requirement


The organizers must be able to regenerate your image using:


```bash
docker build -t reproduced_image .
```


with no missing dependencies and no external manual steps.


Submissions that are **not reproducible** will be rejected.



---



### Local Testing


Participants are encouraged to test locally the submission:

```bash
docker build -t my_submission .

docker run --rm \
  --gpus all \
  -v ./test_input:/input:ro \
  -v ./test_output:/output:rw \
  my_submission \
  bash /workspace/run.sh
```

---

## Final Notes

This challenge uses a **sandboxed black-box evaluation model**:
- Your container is treated as an isolated executable
- Only input/output behavior matters
- Internal implementation is irrelevant to scoring

Design for **determinism, reproducibility, and robustness**.
